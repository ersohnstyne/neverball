* DEDICATED GAME NETWORK SUPPORT

For  information on how to build the game  with dedicated game network
support on Windows and Linux,  see instructions  in the source file in
the source archive.

To use it,  first make sure you've set up  all the Wi-Fi  or  Ethernet
in  your  kernel.  Ethernet  is  best  recommended  for  this  server.
Once this is done,  you'll need to find out your server's  IP  address
like this:

    RPI4:

        $ ip a
        1: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc
        pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b8:27:eb:e8:5b:61 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 192.168.8.249/24 brd 192.168.8.255 scope global
        noprefixroute eth0
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 2a04:4540:7312:2700:2fef:27f9:3dd6:ac66/64 scope
        global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute 
               valid_lft 6993sec preferred_lft 3393sec
            inet6 fe80::2021:7fef:4dca:f819/64 scope link 
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

    Ubuntu OCI:

        $ ip a
        1: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9000 qdisc
        pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 02:00:17:00:d7:c3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            altname enp0s3
            inet 10.0.0.199/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global ens3
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 fe80::17ff:fe00:d7c3/64 scope link
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

    Windows PC:

        C:\>ping 192.168.8.249

        Ping wird ausgeführt für 192.168.8.249 mit 32 Bytes Daten:
        Antwort von 192.168.8.249: Bytes=32 Zeit=1ms TTL=64

        Ping-Statistik für 192.168.8.249:
            Pakete: Gesendet = 1, Empfangen = 1, Verloren = 0
            (0% Verlust),
        Ca. Zeitangaben in Millisek.:
            Minimum = 1ms, Maximum = 1ms, Mittelwert = 1ms

This   IPv4   address   must   go   in   the   neverballrc   file   as
"dedicated_ipaddress 192.168.8.249"  so   that  the  game  knows  that
there's a game network to be used.

Now, when  you start the game  everything will proceed normally  but a
background thread will trying to connect the internet.  If  not except
the server,  you'll need to reconfigure the router in order.

When connected to server,  your client's network packet will instantly
increase than previous one.


* WIIMOTE SUPPORT

For information  on how to build  the game with Wiimote  support under
Linux, see instructions in the file INSTALL in the source archive.

To use it, first make sure you've set up all the Bluetooth mumbo-jumbo
in your kernel  and what-not.  Once this is done,  you'll need to find
out your Wiimote's address like this:

    $ hcitool scan
    Scanning ...
            00:1B:7A:3E:45:7F       Nintendo RVL-CNT-01

This  hexadecimal   string  must  go   in  the  neverballrc   file  as
"wiimote_addr 00:1B:7A:3E:45:7F" so that the game knows that there's a
Wiimote to be used.

Now, when  you start the game  everything will proceed normally  but a
background thread  will place your Bluetooth  device into discoverable
mode.  You've got about  15 seconds to press 1 and  2 on your wiimote.
The Wiimote's LEDs will flash, and once the game makes friends with it
the Player 1 LED will be lit.  If you don't activate your Wiimote then
the  game  will  behave  normally and  the  Bluetooth  discovery  will
eventually time out.

From  there,  the  Wiimote  digital  pad works  like  a  joystick  for
navigating menus.  A and  B buttons are the A and  B buttons.  Home is
Pause.  Plus and  Minus are camera rotation controls.   Also, the tilt
sensor controls the floor.

The  Wiimote tilt  sensor is  a  surprisingly noisy  device, so  heavy
filtering is applied to the input.   For this reason, the controls may
feel sluggish.  This might improve with  an IR sensor bar, but has not
been tested.


* HILLCREST LABS LOOP SUPPORT

For  information on how  to build  the game  with Hillcrest  Labs Loop
support on all platforms, see  instructions in the file INSTALL in the
source archive.

To use a loop  to control the game, it must be  plugged in at startup.
If  the  loop  is  plugged  in,  it will  be  chosen  as  the  default
controller.   Hold  the  loop  upright,  and tilt  it  left/right  and
forward/backwards to control the  game.  Occasionally the sensors will
get miscalibrated;  to fix  this, simply  set the loop  on a  table or
stable surface for about 5 seconds, and the controls should be back to
normal.

When  not in game  mode, the  loop will  act like  a mouse  to control
menus.  When the  game is playing, the left  and right buttons control
the camera and the middle button will bring up a pause menu.
